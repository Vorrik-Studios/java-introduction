        /* EXERCISE 1: Simple Calculator
        *
        * Create a Calculator that runs multiple times until you manually break out of it.
        * You should read the operation first, then read the first and second number.
        *
        * Depending on the operation chosen, you then have to return a different result.
        * You can do this with if statements or switch statements.
        *
        * Please note that when reading a String, you want to use scanner.next()
        * And when comparing strings you want to use:
        * String s = "something";
        * s.equals("something");
        * and not ==
        *
        * After the result has be output, ask the user if they want to continue, if not end the program!
        * Estimated Time: 30-45 minutes
        * */
